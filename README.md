# Covid-19 Crisis Management Database
Hi there!ðŸ˜€

Welcome to my Covid-19 Crisis Management Database project.ðŸ§¬ This project was born out of the need to have a comprehensive of the ongoing pandemic in Israel.ðŸ“ˆ

As the leader of a group of students, I coordinated and synchronized our efforts to gather and organize data from various sources, including government agencies and news outlets. Our goal was to create a tool that would allow policymakers and decision-makers to access reliable and relevant information in real-time, in order to make informed decisions about how to address the crisis.

The database includes a range of data points, such as confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing rates, and more. 

I am proud to say that our team was able to deliver a complete and comprehensive database that has proven to be an invaluable resource for those working to manage the crisis. I hope that it will continue to be a useful tool for years to come.

Thank you for visiting this project. I hope you find it as useful and informative as we do.

Sincerely,
Avinoam
